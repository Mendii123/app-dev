## Overview

*All About Lily Chou-Chou* (2001) is a hauntingly poetic Japanese film directed by **Shunji Iwai**.  
It explores the emotional isolation and existential despair of adolescence in a digital age —  
long before social media became what it is today.  
The movie unfolds like a dream that keeps slipping away the moment you think you understand it.
